# Chest X-Ray Age & Gender Prediction
This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting age and gender from chest X-ray images.

## Project Goals
- Investigate the feasibility of predicting age and gender from this type of medical image.
- Explore the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image-based prediction tasks.
- Gain hands-on experience building an AI-driven medical image analysis system.

## Dataset
- Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/felipekitamura/spr-x-ray-age-and-gender-dataset
- Format: .png
- Training Images: 10701 images
- Test Images: 11746 images
- Labels:
    - Gender: Male/Female (Binary)
    - Age: Numeric, typically (0-100)

## Approach
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize and understand patterns in the X-ray images correlated with age and gender.

2. Image Preprocessing: Prepare images for the CNN using OpenCV (resizing, normalization).

3. CNN Model Development: Experiment with different CNN architectures (VGG, ResNet, etc.).

4. Model Evaluation: Use rigorous metrics to assess prediction accuracy.

## Getting Started

### Future Plans (Potential)
- Investigate data augmentation techniques.

- Address potential biases in the dataset and model.

- Explore deploying the model within a medical setting (if results are promising).
